Winforms camera test with OpenCVSharp.  Project says barcode test, but i removed the barcode related code since 
thsi will be handled by a barcode reader.

1) Clone the repo
2) From the sln directory run either nuget restore or nuget install
3) open solution in visual studio 
4) clean solution then build solution
5) run.

Start button starts the camera

"snapshot" button takes a picture and displays the image on the right side of the screen
